### 2. **Improved Turborepo Configuration**
- ✅ Enhanced `turbo.json` with:
  - Better task dependencies and ordering
  - Comprehensive environment variable management
  - Extended output configurations
  - New tasks: `preview`, `start`, `test:coverage`, `test:integration`, `contracts:test`, `db:*`, `docker:*`, `deploy`
  - Improved caching strategies

### 3. **Comprehensive Script Suite**
- ✅ **Setup Script** (`scripts/setup.sh`): Complete project initialization with prerequisites checking
- ✅ **Development Script** (`scripts/dev-web.sh`): Enhanced development environment startup
- ✅ **Database Manager** (`scripts/db-manager.sh`): Complete database lifecycle management
- ✅ **Docker Manager** (`scripts/docker-manager.sh`): Comprehensive Docker operations
- ✅ **Deployment Script** (`scripts/deploy.sh`): Production deployment pipeline
- ✅ All scripts made executable with proper permissions

### 4. **Enhanced Environment Configuration**
- ✅ Created comprehensive `.env.example` with all necessary variables
- ✅ Organized environment variables by category
- ✅ Added security and deployment configurations

### 5. **Improved Docker Configuration**
- ✅ Enhanced `docker-compose.dev.yml` with:
  - Better service configurations
  - Restart policies
  - Health checks
  - Resource limits
  - Improved networking

### 6. **Better Task Management**
- ✅ Added task dependencies to ensure proper build order
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive testing pipeline
- ✅ Enhanced development workflow scripts
- ✅ Added deployment and CI/CD support

## 🔧 Key Features Implemented

### **Development Workflow**
```bash
# Complete project setup
./scripts/setup.sh

# Start development environment
pnpm dev

# Individual service management
pnpm dev:web
pnpm dev:api
pnpm dev:mobile
pnpm dev:contracts
```

### **Docker Management**
```bash
# Start services with profiles
./scripts/docker-manager.sh start database
./scripts/docker-manager.sh start all

# Monitor and manage
./scripts/docker-manager.sh logs web
./scripts/docker-manager.sh status
./scripts/docker-manager.sh clean
```

### **Database Operations**
```bash
# Complete database setup
./scripts/db-manager.sh setup

# Individual operations
./scripts/db-manager.sh migrate
./scripts/db-manager.sh seed

```

### **Deployment Pipeline**
```bash
# Full deployment pipeline
./scripts/deploy.sh full

# Environment-specific deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh staging
./scripts/deploy.sh production
```
